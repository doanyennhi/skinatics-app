# Skinatics

Skinatics is an iOS application with the purpose of helping users find skincare products to help with their skin concerns. In other words, an "on-the-go skincare assistant".

## Features

- Understand a user's skin type, conditions, and concerns, and then recommend suitable products found in nearby stores to help with such concerns.
- Allow a user to search for a product or ingredient, and understand its benefits and purpose in the skincare world.
  - Product barcodes can be scanned as well.
- Users can create a day and night skincare routine to follow for a seamless experience - users will not forget what product is next in their routine!
- Harness the power of AI to see if products users are using are in fact improving their skin.
  - Users take a selfie and skin analysis results are shown, comparing from previous analyses.
