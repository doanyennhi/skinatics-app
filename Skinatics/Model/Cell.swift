The ultra-mild foaming texture provides a gentle approach to cleansing, without drying out the skin. The transformation of oil to foam when lathered on the skin effectively removes excess dirt and impurities, without stripping the skin moisture barrier, an ideal squalane cleanser formula for those with dry or sensitive skin."),
